            <p class="background__paragraph animate__sliding">
                My love for game development is deeply rooted in a lifelong passion for games.
                They have significantly shaped both my life and interests.
                Even my enthusiasm for computer science originates from games.
                During my high school years, while possessing some technical know-how,
                I never found interest in understanding how anything digital worked,
                let alone learning a programming language. However, everything changed when
                a friend recommended a game called
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/" target="_blank">BitBurner</a>,
                a cyberpunk idle game where the player used JavaScript to automate tasks.
                That was the moment I fell in love.
            </p>
            <p class="background__paragraph animate__sliding">
                My journey felt clear-cut from there. I was attending high school at
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://www.headwaters.org" target="_blank">Headwaters School</a>
                in Austin, Texas.
                While school adeptly taught me skills in writing and mathematics, along with valuable
                meta-skills like self-reflection and the skill of learning itself, it lacked computer
                science classes. As a result, I became self-taught, learning through projects,
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>
                problems, and the extensive library of computer science
                knowledge available online (I even learned the fundamentals of computer architecture
                through yet another indie game -
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/" target="_blank">Turing Complete</a>!).
                One summer, having amassed enough technical knowledge, I decided to venture into
                creating my own games.
            </p>
            <p class="background__paragraph animate__sliding">
                For inspiration, I turned to games that have been a significant part of my life.
                I hold a particular affinity for games that weave gripping and powerful stories,
                as well as those finely tuned with mechanics and strategyâ€”better yet, the rare
                ones that seamlessly blend both categories. I could gush over my indie favorites like 
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/" target="_blank">Hollow Knight</a>,
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/" target="_blank">Outer Wilds</a>,
                and 
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/303210/The_Beginners_Guide/" target="_blank">The Beginer's Guide</a>
                for hours and I have sunk hundreds if not thousands
                of hours into compeditive on-going games such as 
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://www.fortnite.com/?lang=en-US" target="_blank">Fortnite</a>,
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" target="_blank">League of Legends</a>,
                and 
                <a class="text__highlight" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>.
                Games have taught me logic and reasoning, skill aquisition, and have touched me
                emotionally in ways that no other form of media ever has.
